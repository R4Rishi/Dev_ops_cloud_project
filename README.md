## Technologies Used
- Terraform: For infrastructure as code (IaC) to automate cloud resource provisioning and management.
- AWS: Leveraging services like Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB for serverless architecture and data storage.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For front-end development of the e-commerce website.
- Git: For version control and collaboration.
  
## Cloud Automation Project
This project focuses on automating infrastructure deployment and management in the cloud using Terraform. Key features include:

- Infrastructure as Code: Defined cloud resources using Terraform scripts to deploy and manage environments consistently.
- CI/CD Pipeline Integration: Automated testing and deployment of infrastructure changes.
- Monitoring and Logging: Integrated cloud monitoring solutions to ensure systems are running smoothly.
- Installation
To run this project locally or in the cloud, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/R4Rishi/Dev_ops_cloud_project/tree/main/Cloud_Automation
cd Cloud-Automation

1.Install Terraform:
# Instructions for installing Terraform based on your OS
## Initialize Terraform:

 terraform init
## Apply the configuration:

- terraform apply
- Cloud-Based Backup and Recovery Solution
This project implements a robust backup and recovery solution in the cloud. It includes:

- Automated Backups: Scheduled backups of critical data stored in S3.
- Disaster Recovery: Strategies to restore data quickly in case of service outages or data loss.
- Cost Management: Utilized lifecycle policies in S3 to manage storage costs effectively.

## Usage
- Configure backup schedules through Terraform scripts.
- Monitor backup status via AWS CloudWatch.

## Serverless E-commerce Website
This project is a fully functional e-commerce website built using serverless architecture. Key components include:

- Frontend: Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive user experience.
- Backend: Implemented using AWS Lambda functions for serverless processing, with DynamoDB for database management and S3 for static file hosting.

## Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/serverless-ecommerce
cd serverless-ecommerce
Deploy the backend services using:

# Instructions for deploying AWS Lambda functions and setting up DynamoDB
Host the frontend in S3:

aws s3 sync ./frontend s3://bucket-name
